Requirements:
- Python
- OpenAI Gym

We will be using OpenAI gym, a toolkit for reinforcement learning.
It also gives some standard set of environments. See [env](https://gym.openai.com/envs/)

Setup is really painful and may not even work in local systems. Rather to simplify the reporducibility, use the Google Colab file.
